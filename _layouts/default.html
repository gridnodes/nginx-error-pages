    As the error page is returned as internal ressource, no external assets
    should be linked, so no extra paths need to be publicly accessible via the
    webserver. Therefore, the following include ensures all required assets to
    be inlined in this HTML template.

    TODO: At the moment, the generated assets are not cached and thus will be
          generated for every single page independently. A cache should be used
          to generate the assets just once for all pages.
