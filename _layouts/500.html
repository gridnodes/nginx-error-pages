{% comment %}
  Various strings of this template should be internationalized according to the
  language the error page is generated for. The following variable provides an
  alias to access the global translations defined in the '_data' directory.

  NOTE: This alias requires the page file to set a 'language' key according to
        the language file to be used in its front matter.

  NOTE: This variable is not accessible in templates inheriting from this one.
