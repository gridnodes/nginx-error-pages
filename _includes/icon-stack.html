  This liquid include file needs a mandatory parameter 'icon', which defines the
  SVG icon file to be used as main component of this icon stack.
{% endcomment %}
{% assign icon = "fontawesome/solid/" | append: include.icon | append: ".svg" %}


<div class="icon-stack">
  <div class="icon icon-grey">
    {% include {{ icon }} %}
  </div>

    The status marker should have a white checkmark or cross embedded. As the
    circle including these figures has a transparent cutout, a white background
    needs to be used instead.
