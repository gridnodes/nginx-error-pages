  This liquid include file needs a mandatory parameter 'icon', which defines the
  SVG icon file to be used as main component of this icon stack.
{% endcomment %}
{% assign icon = "fontawesome/solid/" | append: include.icon | append: ".svg" %}


<div class="icon-stack">
  <div class="icon icon-grey">
    {% include {{ icon }} %}
  </div>

  {% if include.fail != true %}
    <div class="icon icon-mark icon-green">
      {% include svgs/mark-ok.svg %}
    </div>
  {% else %}
    <div class="icon icon-mark icon-red">
